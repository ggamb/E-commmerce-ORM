## Description
I refactored this code to write the backend of an e-commerce website. I used Sequelize, a Node.js object-relational mapping (ORM), along with mySQL2 to create models, associations, and GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for products, categories, and tags. With this code you can work with an existing databse of products, categories, and tags and create, add, update, and delete entries.

The remainder of the code was provided by the University of Texas at Austin Coding Bootcamp.

## Installation

To run this code, clone the code above, navigate to the correct directory, open it in your IDE, and run `npm install` in the terminal to install all dependencies. To ensure that you are able to connect to Sequalize, you may need to create a .env file in the root directory with process.env.DB_NAME, process.env.DB_USER, process.env.DB_PW set up as your database name, username, and password. Then, run `npm run seed` to see the seed the database with data and run `npm start` to run the server. Using Insomnia Core or similar products, you can use the API  GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for products, categories, and tags.
